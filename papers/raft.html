        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Summary</h2>
        <p>
          Raft is a consensus algorithm designed to be more understandable than
          Paxos while providing equivalent fault tolerance and performance. The
          authors explicitly optimized for understandability, making it easier
          to teach and implement in real systems.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10">Key Ideas</h2>
        
        <h3 class="text-xl font-medium mt-6">Leader Election</h3>
        <p>
          Raft uses a strong leader model. Only one server acts as the leader at
          a time, and all client requests go through it. If the leader fails,
          followers can start an election to choose a new leader.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-medium mt-6">Log Replication</h3>
        <p>
          The leader receives commands from clients, appends them to its log,
          and replicates them to follower servers. Once a majority of servers
          have stored the entry, it's considered committed.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-medium mt-6">Safety</h3>
        <p>
          Raft guarantees that committed entries will never be lost and that
          servers will apply the same sequence of commands to their state machines.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10">Why It Matters</h2>
        <p>
          What makes Raft compelling isn't performance—it's clarity. The algorithm
          is decomposed into relatively independent subproblems: leader election,
          log replication, and safety. This makes it much easier to understand
          and implement correctly than Paxos.
        </p>

        <p>
          Many production systems now use Raft, including etcd (used by Kubernetes),
          Consul, and CockroachDB. Its understandability has made it the go-to
          choice for distributed consensus.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10">My Notes</h2>
        <p>
          Reading this paper made distributed consensus click for me. The
          visualization on the Raft website is particularly helpful for
          understanding the election and replication process.
        </p>

        <p>
          One interesting design choice: term numbers act as a logical clock,
          helping servers detect stale information. It's a simple but elegant
          solution to a complex problem.
